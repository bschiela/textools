To-do lists
===========

Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [ ] See A&M notes:
    * [ ] QED not placed properly when thm environment ends with equation; \qedhere doesn't work.
    * [ ] Floats get placed before title.
    * [ ] Generally, optimize form/function (e.g. thm environments, numbers/organization, etc.).
    * [ ] captions aren't justified to figure/table widths

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [ ] `print` option to `wfs-suite.sty`
   * [ ] research side effects on other packages
     (consider global `wfs-print` analogous to `wfs-draft`)
   * [ ] remove colors / switch to grayscale
* [ ] `wfs-book.cls`: For taking long-form notes / 
  For compiling many `wfs-notes.cls`s into book form
* [ ] proper package/class documentation

Miscellaneous
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [ ] consider [tufte-latex](https://ctan.org/pkg/tufte-latex?lang=en)
  as a base class

  the narrower text block of 60-70 characters is supposedly optimal
